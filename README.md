Graphics based Minesweeper
I currently plan to make a randomly generated logical game of graphics based Minesweeper in pyGame. The game should be click interactive and will hopefully have helpful features
Disclaimer: A lot of what I have to do has to be done at the same time to avoid going back. If I don't do something it may add more time.
1. It should take about a week, maybe a week and a half to create buttons that will be pressed. This will likely have to be a double button system with the first cover button just disapearing and the other button actually controlling the mines. (This ended up being a single button system that loaded an image over the existing thing at that point)
2. This step could take a month, or maybe just two weeks. I need to work out the logic for random generation. This needs to be integrated into the button system. (Scraped this, but this still took a while to make functional. The actual problem ended up being making these random numbers usable for the other code)
3. A win system needs to be integrated into the buttons. This will hopefully happen while I am making the random generation and coupling it to the buttons, but it will likely add up to a week. (I will do this with a True False system, but hopefully it will not take a week)
5. I want to add a few aesthetic things and a hopefully a flag system. If possible I will add a timer, but that could be difficult since that requires constant live updating and I would have to learn how you insert that.
